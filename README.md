# Amanda's Dotfiles and Computer Setup Scripts

This has expanded from just my dotfiles to include other scripts that I either
use regularly (like `tat` from [Upcase's tmux course, part 3](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/videos/tmux-navigation)),
as well as scripts I use to setup my new computers (`.setup.sh` and `.install.sh`).

This project isn't organized well (yet) and has the sort of odd convention that
anything without a `.` prefix will have a symlink created in the home directory,
with a `.` prefix.

Additionally, this has all my personal preferences in it as far as tooling and
configuration (including the fact that I develop on macs), so you probably don't
want to use it as is.
